Here are some samples of the different WM running in some of my machine;

In order are Hyprland, Labwc, LeftWM. Openbox, Qtile and Sway.

All of them are with my configs, so expect some minor differences when you install them for the first time, like weather conditions, BAT and WIFI states.

But it is pretty much what you will see on boot.
