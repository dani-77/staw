Acknowledgments
-------------

I would like to extend my gratitude to my close friends J.F. Correia and R. Gomez, as well as my brother J.P. Azevedo, for their invaluable testing, feedback, and suggestions.

I am also thankful to K. Figueroa and Johna1 for their contributions to the Calamares port, which significantly simplified the process of porting Calamares to d77void.

A special thank you to the Void developers for their dedication to creating a robust system and providing useful tools like void-mklive and void-packages.

I am grateful for the inspiration and guidance provided by G. Parri (GabeeOS), Crowz, and TileOS, whose work has greatly influenced my approach.

I am grateful for the contributions of A. Garbe, whose suckless philosophy and exceptional tools - including st, dwm, and dmenu - have greatly influenced my approach to minimalistic and efficient design.

Additionally, Garbe's static site generator, staw, simplified the deployment process for this site.

I would like to express my appreciation to Sourceforge for kindly hosting the project.

Lastly, I would like to thank my wife and kids for their unwavering patience and support, without which this project would not have been possible.

Thank you all!

Daniel
